It's not too much of a stretch, I believe, to say that microscopically we recognize what's alive by looking at sets of molecules binding and unbinding in a coordinated and concerted manner. Examples abound: RNA polymerase starts off transcription by binding to DNA; trascription factors control the transcriptional rate by binding to DNA sequences; ribosomes synthesize proteins by binding to mRNA; amminoacids bind to tRNA providing the building blocks during protein synthesis; extra-cellular molecular are sensed by receptor proteins kickstarting a signalling cascades thank to which the cell adapts its metabolism and whatnot to the current environment and signalling cascades consist of binding and reaction events; proteins change function after some other protein binds to them; and so on and on, the list is endless really and the take-home message here is that any biological event is some kind of binding event microscopically.

Admittedly, I am using the concept of binding a little more loosely than real biologists would like. As far as I can see, binding usually means that two molecules stick to one another maintaining their identities as in the classic example of oxygen binding to hemoglobin. If two molecules wander around, meet and react, losing their identity because of a chemical transformation, this would hardly be called a binding event. Still, chemical reactions happen locally, ie, molecules have to 'stick' to one another first in some sense. Thinking about chemical reactions this way leads one straight to the [reaction-diffusive systems](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system>) formalism for instance , so I think there is some real merit about extending the concept of binding to any 'molecular meeting' so to speak, both pedagogically and for the purpose of mathematical modelling.
	
Sweeping statements such as the one above are almost as useless as they are useful, of course. Ok, so molecules move, meet, bind, unbind, react and they do in a somewhat coordinate manner in living systems, that tells me what? How do they move? How do they meet? How do they bind? How do they react? What exactly defines coordination in this context? These questions are surely harder than the big philosophical picture. That is true, but in this case we know a hell of a lot already about these questions *individually*. I have the impression that much of what's hard about biophysics and biology is connect the things we already know from basic physics and chemistry and figure out how they interact to produce the features present in living systems. This is why a bird's eye view of what's going on is useful, as opposed to putting your head down and focus on a single mechanism.

In addition, sweeping statements are very useful despite their generality if one knows how to translate them mathematically. The mathematics will be rather generic as well, but from there it becomes much easier to become more precise and precise. The atomic hypothesis has been claimed as the most important piece of science ever produced, the one piece of information we should hold on to for future generations if all science were be to destroyed except for a single fact. What does the atomic hypothesis say? That all matter is made of tiny particles interacting with one another, roughly attracting one another at long distance and repelling one another at short distances. This is already helpful, no doubt, but if you don't know how to put this statement in the language of Newton's differential equations or in the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics, even the atomic hypothesis loses much of its power. 

So, once we accept that in order to understand living system we must consider the motion of molecules as it relates to binding and reaction events, how shall we put this mathematically? The answer is the mathematics of random walks with various increasing levels of complications.
