title: "A practical review of brownian motion"

I am going to start with the simplest random walk model, brownian motion. Brownian motion describes the motion of molecules in a solvent, moving under the influence of the collisions with the small fluid particles. It was discovered more than a hundred years, but even such old and well-known model contains several non-trivial results that aren't really well-known. Everybody has seen the weird square root scaling of the distance with time, but once you start asking about first-passage times and the effect of confinedness many students have no clue. 

In describing brownian motion, it is important to switch confidently from discrete models to continuous models, both in space and time. This is helpful both analytically and computationally and it is the focus of this review.

Let us start with a completely discrete model. At any time $t \in \mathbb{N} $, the particle is described by state $\mathbf{n} \in \mathbb{N}^d $, a position in a discrete $d$-dimensional lattice. A trajectory $N$-steps long $\{\mathbf{n_0}, \mathbf{n_1}, .., \mathbf{n_N}\}$ is generated by starting from a position $\mathbf{n_0}$, choosing randomly the next position among the $2d$ possible neighbors, moving to this neighbor and repeating the process. Physically, translation and rotational symmetry are assumed, therefore each neighbor is chosen uniformy with probability $\frac{1}{2d}$ for any starting position.  At this point, the model is completely defined and one can start simulating trajectories with a computer for example.
