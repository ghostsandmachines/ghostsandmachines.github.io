title: "A practical review of brownian motion"

I am going to start with the simplest random walk model, brownian motion. Brownian motion describes the motion of molecules in a solvent, moving under the influence of the collisions with the small fluid particles. It was discovered more than a hundred years, but even such old and well-known model contains several non-trivial results that aren't really well-known. Everybody has seen the weird square root scaling of the distance with time, but once you start asking about first-passage times and the effect of confinedness many students have no clue.

  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping!

 $\pi^2 + \exp (i \theta)$

 $$ \pi^2 + \exp (i \theta) $$
