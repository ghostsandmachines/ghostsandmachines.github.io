<h1>Hello world.</h1>

<p>
This website contains a bunch of projects and notes mostly science-related, plus the occasional ranting. In these fair well-spoken days, I am into system biology, biophysics and statistical mechanics and I am doing a PhD in those fields. Check out below some of the topics covered in the blog or look <a href="/blog/list/">here </a> for the full lists of my posts.
