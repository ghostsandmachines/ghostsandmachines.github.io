		<h1>Hi there. </h1>
		<p> I have a background in physics and right now I am mainly interested in biophysics and statistical mechanics, but I'll take insight anywhere I can get it. I don't like territoriality when it comes to science and knowledge.</p>

		<p>This website is intended as a space for me to publish a bunch of projects, review some topics, write some pedagogical notes and muse more or less freely on some problem that interests me. Hopefully you find something here that is enjoyable and informative. If you spot any errors, technical, conceptual or typographical, please feel free to point them out. 

		<p>Next, I'll spam my big-picture view on biophysics and stat mech. Keep in mind my thinking on these subjects is still evolving and pretty far from equilibrium.</p>

		 <h2> Biophysics </h2>

		 <p>Biologists give physicists the notion of function, almost always banned in the physics field and relegated instead to engineering. Living systems must achieve some sorts of functionality, in fact rather a lot of it. Physicists give biologists the problems, the constraints and the limits that have to be faced by any organism to achieve different sorts of functionality. Flies can't just keep on adding photoreceptors to their compound eye in order to improve their vision because at some point they hit the diffraction limit. Mammals cannot be bigger than a certain size because the fluid dynamics of the circulatory systems dictates that capillaries cannot service efficiently their neighoboring cells with oxygen at that point. Bacteria can't just add metabolic genes to their repertoire without incurring into some very real regulatory costs. Transcription factors cannot just tune gene expression levels to any desired value because of intrinsic molecular noise due to the randomness of diffusion and the binding/unbinding process. </p>

		<p>Within this framework, the way to go to reach a quantitative understanding of life is to think hard about what it is exactly the aim the organism is trying to achieve and how basic physics and chemistry informs the possibility of achieving such aim. A dream theory, I suppose, would consist of classifying biological functions, perhaps by degree of importance as well, describing the way physics affects them and listing out, perhaps by effectiveness, the various strategies that organisms can use to achieve functionality.</p>

		<p>Although I'm currently convinced this is the right approach in a very large number of cases, it seems apparent that above a certain scale the behavior of living system is not quite constrained by basic physics in the same way. I think that the scheme function <i>vs</i> limit is still helpful, but at some point constraints and limits to function of a living system come less from basic physics and more from <em>other</em> living systems, both because of intra- and inter-species interactions. Perhaps such interactions enlarge the space of the possible, ie, cooperation, perhaps they diminish it, ie, competition, but at any rate, in this case to understand behavior is likely more helpful to think about the strategic interactions between the various agents involved and their related strategic equilibria, instead of the basic physics involved and its related physical limits. I am currently more interested in the latter problem, the relationship between biological function and basic physics, but my next logical step would be to think about ecological interactions, both by themselves and as part of multiscale models.</p>

		<p>I am currently working on:</p>

			<ul>
				<li> finding growth laws and exploring their consequences in mammalian cells. Broadly-speaking, growth laws are empirical relationships between ribosomal content, protein expression and growth rate. They quantify at the global level the way gene expression is coupled to the growth state of the cell. For instance, we might ask how the ribosome content changes as the nutrient quality in the surrounding. Rather interestingly the ribosomal fraction depends on the nutrient quality through a simple increasing linear relationship with the growth rate (itself a function of nutrient quality), a clear-cut growth law relating the growth state of the cell with the activity of the gene expression network. Overall, various mathematical relations have been uncovered for bacteria, but much work remains to be done to extend such theory to higher organism. Much of this work consists of finding limiting factors for single cell growth and studying the way they affect protein allocation.</li>

				<li> universal patterns across bacteria in their gene content structure. Since 1995, when the first bacterial genome_s_ were sequenced, thousands of other genomes have been sequenced. From the point of view of biophysics, the possibility of comparing thousands of genomes is a unique way to study universal principles of genome organization and organismal design, presumably reflecting general physical constraints and requirements that every organism has to obey. For instance, one of the most striking discoveries in this area are the so-called Nimwegen's laws, ie, the distinct scaling of different functional gene categories with genome size ($N_c \propto S^{\alpha_f}$) and several other patterns have been uncovered. I look at the abundance statistics of evolutionary and functional categories of protein-coding genes, carefully analyse the patterns found therein trying to understand if they are signatures of biophysical principles or neutral evolutionary dynamics, or even just robust statistical artificats of the data framework. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Though I've not worked on the topic, I am also very interested in the biophysics of the molecular dogma from the search problem to the role of noise in gene expression all the way to the consequences of nonfunctional molecular interactions. Finally, in the past, I've worked on the dynamics of chromosomal loci in E. Coli, mostly from a purely phenomenological point of view, figuring out a little model quantifying the timescales of the intermittent ballistic motion exhibited by such loci in recent experiments (previously only the subdiffusive dynamics at short timescales was considered). In the future, I would like to investigate in more detail how the physical properties of the cytoplasm, in particular molecular crowding, affect the physiology of the cell.</p>
