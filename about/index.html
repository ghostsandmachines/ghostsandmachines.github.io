	<h1>Hi there. </h1>
	<p> I have a background in physics and right now I am mainly interested in biophysics and statistical mechanics, but I'll take insight anywhere I can get it. I don't like territoriality when it comes to science and knowledge.

	This website is intended as a space for me to publish a bunch of projects, review some topics, write some pegadogical notes and muse more or less freely on some problem that interests me. Hopefully you find something here that is enjoyable and informative. If you spot any errors, technical, conceptual or typographical, please feel free to point them out. Quite obviously, the website is a work-in-progress as of now, 14<sub>th</sub> of January, 2019.

	Next, I'll spam my big-picture view on biophysics and stat mech. Keep in mind my thinking on these subjects is still evolving and pretty far-from-equilibrium.

	 <h3> Biophysics </h3>

	 <p>Biologists give physicists the notion of function, almost always banned in the physics field and relegated instead to engineering. Living systems must achieve some sorts of functionality, in fact rather a lot of it. Physicists give biologists the problems, the constraints and the limits that have to be faced by any organism to achieve different sorts of functionality. Flies can't just keep on adding photoreceptors to their compound eye in order to improve their vision because at some point they hit the diffraction limit. Mammals cannot be bigger than a certain size because the fluid dynamics of the circulatory systems dictates that capillaries cannot service efficiently their neighoboring cells with oxygen at that point. Bacteria can't just add metabolic genes to their repertoire without incurring into some very real regulatory costs. Transcription factors cannot just tune gene expression levels to any desired value because of intrinsic molecular noise due to the randomness of diffusion and the binding/unbinding process. 

	Within this framework, the way to go to reach a quantitative understanding of life is to think hard about what it is exactly the aim the organism is trying to achieve and how basic physics and chemistry informs the possibility of achieving such aim. A dream theory, I suppose, would consist of classifying biological functions, perhaps by degree of importance as well, describing the way physics affects them and listing out, perhaps by effectiveness, the various strategies that organisms can use to achieve functionality.

	Although I'm currently convinced this is the right approach in a very large number of cases, it seems apparent that above a certain scale the behavior of living system is not quite constrained by basic physics the same way. I think that the scheme function vs limit is still helpful, but at some point constraints and limits to function of a living system come less from basic physics and more from OTHER living systems, both because of intra- and inter-species interactions. Perhaps such interactions enlarge the space of the possible, ie, cooperation, perhaps they diminish it, ie, competition, but at any rate, in this case to understand behavior is likely more helpful to think about the strategic interactions between the various agents involved and their related strategic equilibria, instead of the basic physics involved and its related physical limits. I am currently more interested in the latter problem, the relationship between biological function and basic physics, but my next logical step would be to think about ecological interactions, both by themselves and as part of multiscale models.

	Given the approach above, what specific biological function and physical limits should one study? Well, two usual heuristics that we employ to decide what to do is to do what's most important or what's easiest and more often than not we end up doing a combination of both. Even more often we actually end up doing whatever is available at the time. I am currently particularly interested in:

<ul>
	<li> the physiological effects of molecular crowding inside the cell </li>
	<li> the role of noise in the regulatory processes of the cell </li>
	<li> genome evolution in bacteria, figuring out the way the patterns of abundance in gene content are related to the underlying evolutionary dynamics; evolutionary rules constrain the space of the possible, too, so for instance living systems might not reach a certain functionality because the search algorithm doesn't allow to reach it, not because of the physical impossibility of the functional outcome </li>
</ul>

	Recently, I've been appreciating both the scope of information processing in living systems and the way that it really seems to be much more than a metaphor, as there is a quite sophisticated mathematical machinery allowing us to make real predictions. This is something I would like to get deep into going forward.</p>
