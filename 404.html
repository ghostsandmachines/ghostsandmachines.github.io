  <p>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,</p>
  <p>The dark threw its patches down upon me also,</p>
  <p>The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,</p>
  <p>My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?</p>
  <p>Nor it is you alone who know what it is to be evil,</p>
  <p>I am he who knew what it was to be evil,</p>
  <p>I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,</p>
  <p>Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,</p>
  <p>Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,</p>
  <p>Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,</p>
  <p>The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.	</p>
