  <h1>Whoops, this page doesn't exist (404 error). </h1>

  <p>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, <br>
  The dark threw its patches down upon me also,<br>
  The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,<br>
  My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?<br>
  Nor it is you alone who know what it is to be evil,<br>
  I am he who knew what it was to be evil,<br>
  I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,<br>
  Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,<br>
  Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,<br>
  Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,<br>
  The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me. <br>
