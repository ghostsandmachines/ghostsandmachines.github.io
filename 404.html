  <h1>Whoops, this page doesn't exist. (404 error)</h1>

  <p>
  It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
  The dark threw its patches down upon me also,
  The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,
  Nor it it you alone who know what it is to be evil,
  I am he who knew what it was to be evil,
  I too knitted the old know of contrariety,
  Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,
  Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,
  Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallo, sly, cowardly, malignant,
  The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.
